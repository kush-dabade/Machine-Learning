This repository is a collection of my projects, notebooks, and experiments while learning machine learning.  
It documents my progress from beginner-level concepts to more advanced models, with an emphasis on **understanding the fundamentals** rather than just achieving high accuracy.

---

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here
- **Beginner Projects** — simple examples like linear regression, classification, and basic visualizations.
- **Data Preprocessing** — handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding, and splitting datasets.
- **Model Training** — using scikit-learn and other libraries to build and train models.
- **Evaluation Metrics** — R², MAE, MSE, RMSE, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
- **Visualization** — plotting data distributions, regression lines, and model performance.

## 🎯 Goal
The goal of this repository is to **build a strong foundation** in machine learning by working on hands-on examples, understanding each step of the process, and improving my problem-solving skills.

---

## 📅 Progress
I’ll keep adding new notebooks and projects as I learn new concepts.

## 💡 Note
This repo is a personal learning log — expect gradual improvements and experiments over time.
